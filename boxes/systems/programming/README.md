# systems : programming

Examples of programming operating systems in C, Python, OCamel and Java

## Goals

### Concepts
- The different types of programming high-level languages
- strong vs weak typed
- Functional vs Object-orientated etc
- Compiling into Assembly language and Machine Code

### Tasks and challenges
- get to know your C compiler
- compile (into assembly and machine code) and run basic program in c
- get to know your python interpreter
- run basic program in python
- get to grips with a functional language
- run basic program in Ocaml
- learn what Java is all about...

How to compile?



**What is gcc?** GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collections which is used to compile mainly C and C++ language. It translates our code into machine language (1s and 0s).

```bash
gcc filename -o outputfile
```

### Exercises:

1. What version of gcc do you have?
2. Where is your gcc located on your computer?
3. Compile and run hello.c
4. What is going on under the hood?

## Hello C World II: unpacking the different levels of compilation


### Preprocessing
```bash
gcc -E filename -o outputfile
```

### Compiling into assembly code
```bash
gcc -S filename -o outputfile
```
 
### Assembling
```bash
gcc -c filename -o outputfile
```

### Linking


### Putting it all together
```bash
gcc filename -o outputfile
```

So now we know how a C program gets converted to an executable!!!
