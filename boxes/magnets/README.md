## Magnetism

When electrons move they produce ("induce") a magnetic field. This baffled physicists until the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when it was finally realized that electricty and magnetism were fundamentally linked. Moving charges produce magnetic fields, and magnetic fields cause charges to move. We will use this connection in many useful ways.

This symmetry between electricity and magnetism is not perfect. Unlike the sub-atomic particles with a single positve or negative charge, nature does not seem to have an equivalent "monopole" for magnetism. All magnetic materials fields are created from "dipoles", where the two poles have been named North and South, referencing the initial importance of magnets as compasses.

For some atoms...dipole moment.

Current flowing through a straight piece of conductor produces a circular magenetic field surrounding the wire. A magnetic field, like an electric field, just means that something "magnetic" will feel a force when it is within the field. The field created by current flowing through a wire is directly proportional to how much current is flowing, the more current, the stronger the field.

However, this field is still quite weak, we can make it larger if we align the field lines by changing the shape of the wire. If we wind the wire into a coil, then all of the circular magentic fields will line up, and add together, increasing the strength of the field every time we add another loop. We can use coils of wire to create electromagnets that can interact with magnetic materials when we run a current through them.

The opposite is also true.
