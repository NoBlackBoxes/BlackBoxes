### Grey

1. Build an electromagnet. (6V accros coil next to magnet)
2. Build a telegraph (coil + battery + putty + paper clip).
3. Build a dancing coil. (Make sure contact is good, make sure coil resistance is greater than 4 Ohms)

### White

1. Use an inductor to build a "choke". Power a lightbulb (or LED) via an inductor in paralell. What happens?
2. Create a wireless inductive power transfer circuit. Two coils, seperated by an air gap, one connected to battery, the other to an LED/Lightbulb
3. Build a speaker.
4. Build a microphone (mic jack pin input differs from audio output?)
