### Topics

- Why digital? - noise, simplicity, speed
  - Can still represent any value (count in binary)
- How digital? Comparator (op-amp with posiitve feedback)
  - Caveats: threshold noise...need hysterisis (Schmitt-Trigger)
- What about analog signals? simple ADC (4-level)...need logic to turn this into 2-bit binary

#### Tools

- Components (LM339, resistor ladder, LEDs)
