## First Topic

Each topic is a brief lesson, paired with a video tutorial, covering the important information and concluding with one or more exercises and challenges.

- Images can (and should) be included to help explain the topic. They should use relative links to an _images folder within the box's/topic's subfolder.

<p align="center">
<img src="_images/example.png" alt="Example Image" width="450" height="300">
<p>

- The tutorial video will be embedded after the topic intro. Generally, there should be one tutorial video per topic.
  - The videos will only be embedded in the final "github page", so for now, links to online content should be used.
