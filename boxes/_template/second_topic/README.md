# _template : Second_topic

Some topics within a greybox will have an associated folder (with a README). These topic folders will contain other resources needed for that topic's lesson (code, datasheets, example data, etc.). These resources will be referenced by the main topic README as required. Sub-folders within the topic folder can contain resources specific to each exercise/challenge, or simply other projects/versions.
