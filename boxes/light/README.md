## Goals

### Grey

1. Light a lightbulb, think about the jiggling electrons.

### White

1. Build two dipole antennas (transmitter and receiver)...a wireless telegraph.
2. Use an inductor to build a "choke". Power a lightbulb (or LED) via an inductor in paralell. What happens? (decay times)

## Electromagnetic Wave

When a material becomes very hot, it starts to "glow". Why?

- Where does the energy go?
- What is heat?
- What is too much heat?
- How does a lightbulb work?
- (What is light?)

### Exercise: Light a lightbulb

### Exercise: Dim a lightbulb with a variable resistor

----

## Inductors

- Needed?
