# Light

In this box, we will learn about light...how to measure it and how to **create** it.

## Topics
- EM waves (wiggle/accelerate electron - light)
  - energy ~ frequency
  - wavelength, c
- PMT
  - photons?
- (NEW) Polarization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhhHPOxTUy8
- Wave picture (Huygens)
  - Wavefront
Light hits stuff?
- absorb
- reflect
- refract
- scatter
- Refraction (Snell's Law)
  - Different materials let EM wave through easier/harder....same freq, less wavelength....slower
  - index of refaction
- Reflection
  - QED: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Feynmans_QED_probability_amplitudes.gif
- Diffraction
- Two slits (interference)
- Lenses (or curved mirrors)

## Goals

### Grey

1. Light a lightbulb, think about the jiggling electrons.

### White

1. Build two dipole antennas (transmitter and receiver)...a wireless telegraph.
2. Use an inductor to build a "choke". Power a lightbulb (or LED) via an inductor in paralell. What happens? (decay times)

## Electromagnetic Wave

When a material becomes very hot, it starts to "glow". Why?

- Where does the energy go?
- What is heat?
- What is too much heat?
- How does a lightbulb work?
- (What is light?)

### Exercise: Light a lightbulb

### Exercise: Dim a lightbulb with a variable resistor

## Inductors

- Needed?
