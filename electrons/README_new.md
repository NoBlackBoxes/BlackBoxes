# Electrons

Electrons are sub-atomic particles with a negative electric charge. Their negative charge produces a *force* that attracts positive charges and repels negative charges.

In this box, we will learn about electricity...how to measure it and how to **control** it.

### Electric Fields

Electric fields describe the force a charged particle would feel when near an electron.

### Voltage

Voltage describes the difference in charge in one location versus another.

### Current

Electrons moving in a conductor (pushed by a voltage) create a current.
