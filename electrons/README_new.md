# Electrons

Electrons are sub-atomic particles with a negative electric charge. Their negative charge produces a *force* that attracts positive charges and repels negative charges.

In this box, we will learn about electricity...how to measure it and how to **control** it.

### Required Materials

- {01}: NBB-11, multimeter
- {10}: NBB-21, multimeter
- {11}: NBB-31, multimeter, oscilliscope

## Electric Fields

Electric fields describe the force that a charged particle feels when nearby another charged particle.

## Voltage

Voltage describes the difference in net charge in one location versus another.

  - **Task**: Build a battery. Upload a photo of your design and the voltage generated (as shown on the multimeter screen).*(build_a_battery:photo)*

## Current

Electrons moving in a conductor (pushed by a voltage) create a current.

## Ohm's Law

A simple, linear, relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.
