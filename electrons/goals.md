1. Measure the voltage across a AA battery.
2. Measure the resistance of your resistors.
3. Measure the voltage delivered by 4xAA batteries in series.
4. Measure the current flowing through a known resistor when you apply a known voltage (i.e. confirm *Ohm's Law*).
5. Build a voltage divider circuit that divides the input voltage in half.
6. Build a variable voltage source using a potentiometer.
7. Charge a capacitor.


### White

1. Write down the equation that determines the output voltage at the midpoint of a two resitor voltage divider based on the values of each resitor (R1 and R2).
2. Build an RC filter.
