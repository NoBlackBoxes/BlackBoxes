### Grey

1. Build a Braitenberg verhicle the moves towards light
2. Build a Braitenberg verhicle the avoids light

### White

1. Build a Braitenberg verhicle with active components
2. Build a Braitenberg verhicle that responds to sound


### NOTES

- Careful mounting/aligning motors. If the encoder wheel is contacted, the wheels won't spin due to gear ratio.
- Screws for bearings are imperial....don't lose nut
- The cables have a funky long purple wire...by mistake
- Could build comparator for alternating left-right follower-bot using Op-Amp with positve feedback?
